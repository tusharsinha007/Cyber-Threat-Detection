# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Detection & Prediction System

A simple yet impactful system that leverages AWS services and database integration to predict potential cyber threats based on historical data.

## 🔍 Overview

This project implements a cyber threat prediction system that uses AWS's machine learning capabilities and robust database integration to analyze patterns and predict potential security threats before they materialize. By focusing on simplicity and effectiveness, this system provides actionable intelligence for cybersecurity professionals.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **ML-Powered Threat Prediction**: Utilizes AWS SageMaker to build and deploy machine learning models for threat prediction
- 🗄️ **Database Integration**: Seamless integration with AWS RDS and DynamoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval
- 📊 **Real-time Analytics**: Leverages AWS Kinesis for real-time data processing and analytics
- 🔐 **Security Scoring**: Automated risk assessment and security scoring system
- 📱 **Alert System**: Configurable alert mechanisms using AWS SNS and Lambda
- 📈 **Visualization Dashboard**: Interactive dashboards built with AWS QuickSight
